# Larq Compute Engine Python API

The LCE Python API allows you to convert a Keras model built with `larq` to an LCE-compatible TensorFlow Lite FlatBuffer format for inference. The package also includes a reference interpreter useful for accuracy evaluation and debugging.

## Installation

Before installing the LCE Python API and the converter, please install:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) version `3.6`, `3.7`, or `3.8`
- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install) version `1.14`, `1.15`, `2.0`, `2.1`, `2.2` or `2.3` (recommended):
  ```shell
  pip install tensorflow  # or tensorflow-gpu
  ```

You can install `larq-compute-engine` with Python's [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) package manager:

```shell
pip install larq-compute-engine
```
