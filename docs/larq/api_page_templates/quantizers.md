# `larq.quantizers`

A Quantizer defines the way of transforming a full precision input to a quantized output and the pseudo-gradient method used for the backwards pass.

Quantizers can either be used through quantizer arguments that are supported for Larq layers, such as `input_quantizer` and `kernel_quantizer`; or they can be used similar to activations, i.e. either through an `Activation` layer, or through the `activation` argument supported by all forward layers:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import larq as lq
...
x = lq.layers.QuantDense(64, activation=None)(x)
x = lq.layers.QuantDense(64, input_quantizer="ste_sign")(x)
```

is equivalent to:

```python
x = lq.layers.QuantDense(64)(x)
x = tf.keras.layers.Activation("ste_sign")(x)
x = lq.layers.QuantDense(64)(x)
```

as well as:

```python
x = lq.layers.QuantDense(64, activation="ste_sign")(x)
x = lq.layers.QuantDense(64)(x)
```

We highly recommend using the first of these formulations: for the other two formulations, intermediate layers - like batch normalization or average pooling - and shortcut connections may result in non-binary input to the convolutions.

Quantizers can either be referenced by string or called directly.
The following usages are equivalent:

```python
lq.layers.QuantDense(64, kernel_quantizer="ste_sign")
```

```python
lq.layers.QuantDense(64, kernel_quantizer=lq.quantizers.SteSign(clip_value=1.0))
```
